I am an MSc. student in Computer Science at Mila and McGill University, supervised by [Prof. Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/) and [Prof. Dzmitry Bahdanau](https://rizar.github.io/). The goal of my research is to create efficient, adaptable AI systems that can seamlessly integrate into everyday life, ensuring accessibility and trust for all.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Science - Machine Intelligence at the University of Toronto. I was also a research intern at Vector Institute and the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Prof. Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/), where I work on large language model (LLM) attribution, modularity, and knowledge transfer.

Before that, I have spent a year at Huawei Canada working on AI infrastructure, network protocols, network simulators, and AI for network.
Additionally, I worked at the Advanced Electronics and Photonics Research Center at the National Research Council Canada under the guidance of Dr. Guocheng Liu, where I applied machine learning techniques to digital signal processing in optical and wireless communications.
