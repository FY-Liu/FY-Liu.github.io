I am a fourth-year undergraduate student major in Engineering Science - Machine Intelligence at the University of Toronto. 
The goal of my research is to create efficient, adaptable AI systems that can seamlessly integrate into everyday life, ensuring accessibility and trust for all.

Currently, I am a research intern at Vector Institute and the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Prof. Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/), where I work on large language model (LLM) attribution, modularity, and knowledge transfer.
Previously, I have spent a year at Huawei Canada working on AI infrastructure, network protocols, network simulators, and AI for network.
Additionally, I worked at the Advanced Electronics and Photonics Research Center at the National Research Council Canada under the guidance of Dr. Guocheng Liu, where I applied machine learning techniques to digital signal processing in optical and wireless communications.
